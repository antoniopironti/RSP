# RSP
Placeholder project for a Rock-Scissors-Paper game implementation as a single page web application.

## Stack

Nothing has been really defined yet. Here is what I'm going to take into account:

**Backend**
* Django REST framework
* SQLlite
* MongoDB
* Elasticsearch
* socket.io
* Firebase

**Frontend**
* Backbone
* Lodash
* Marionettejs
* Bootstrap
* React

## TODO
* **Games and rounds**: Every *Player vs Player* or *Player vs Computer* game is composed by 5 rounds. Who wins 3 rounds wins the game.
* **Points**: Points are assigned to users at the end of a game:
  * Win: 3 points
  * Draw: 1 point
  * Loss: 0 points
* **User stats and scores**
